*** SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS ***

FIND PASSOWRD - found passwords are displayed in message pane similar to Add Password Confirmation pane

ADD PASSWORD - keep a counter to number of passwords added (in terms of given account). If (count >= 2) display error message. (this is useful for searching purposes as descreases risk of stack overflow)

ADD PASSWORD - user may not have 'username' associated with an account. If user leaves "username" field empty, the program automatically add "none" to the field.

ADD PASSWORD - allow user to select where to save .txt file containing passwords (file is created by default in "Documents" folder)

Update Version(v2.0) - On MAIN window, include a TABLE that displays the passwords already on file. If nothing on file, table is empty.

Update Version(v2.0) - ADD encryptation
