FIND PASSOWRD - found passwords are displayed in message pane similar to Add Password Confirmation pane

FIND PASSOWRD - "FIND" button is disable as long text-field is empty. If user enter input on text-field, "FIND" button becomes enabled.

ADD PASSWORD - keep a counter to number of passwords added (in terms of given account). If (count >= 2) display error message. (this is useful for searching purposes as descreases risk of stack overflow)
