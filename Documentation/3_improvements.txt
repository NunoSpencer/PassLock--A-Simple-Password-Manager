******** COMPLETED ************ ENTER functionality for buttons, such as when user presses ENTER key with searchPassword textfield focused, a search is performed (similar to clicking SEARCH BUTTON)

******** COMPLETED ************ SEARCH FEATURE: force # of same accounts to be 5, i.e. user can only have 5 same accounts. To do this, upon ADD NEW the file is search for matches of same 
  account. If exceeds 5, show ERROR message that only 5 same accounts can be added. This prevents the output window to be immensely large (if user decides to)
  add immensely # of same accounts)  

navigation - add ENTER keyboard feature to buttons, so user can press enter on a button, alternatively to mouse click

 ***** COMPLETED ******* FIND PASSOWRD - found passwords are displayed in message pane similar to Add Password Confirmation pane    

***** COMPLETED ******* FIND PASSOWRD - "FIND" button is disable as long text-field is empty. If user enter input on text-field, "FIND" button becomes enabled.   

ADD PASSWORD - user may not have 'username' associated with an account. If user leaves "username" field empty, the program automatically add "none" to the field.

ADD PASSWORD - allow user to select where to save .txt file containing passwords (file is created by default in "Documents" folder)

Update Version(v2.0) - On MAIN window, include a TABLE that displays the passwords already on file. If nothing on file, table is empty.

Update Version(v2.0) - ADD encryptation
