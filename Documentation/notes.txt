 * null pointer dereferenced has been uncheked from box on Netbeans Settings (->Options -> Editor -> uncheck Null Pointer Dereferenced)
 * TECHNICALITIES: 
 *
 * SEARCH button: note that I did not program the SEARCH button in a new Dialog Box. Instead I used a JOptionPane to get input for the string 
 * to search. Once user presses OK a JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(fram, lines of result). NOTE that multiple lines can be returned in the message box. 
 * Therefore, I must collect the lines to a variable arrayList* of String, to show the variable (i.e the lines) in the Message box. *ArrayList is used
 * because of the need to grow the array (as lines are found). (regular arrays cannot grow nor shwrink)
 * 
 * GET FILE button: note that the default file to be read/write is called passwordRepository.txt; NOTE that if the file is not in the given directory path
 * the program automatically creatres the file. If the file is there, the program only re-writes the file.
