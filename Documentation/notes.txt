 Search feature - I must collect the lines to a variable arrayList* of String, to show the variable (i.e the lines) in the Message box. *ArrayList is used
 * because of the need to grow the array (as lines many matches may are found). (arrays are fixed in size)
 * 
 * GET FILE button: note that the default file to be read/write is called passwordRepository.txt; NOTE that if the file is not in the given directory path
 * the program automatically creatres the file. If the file is already created, it will be overwritten.
