PASSLOCK V1.0


- A simple password manager using Java SWING and Netbeans IDE - 

Are you having a hard time keeping track of all your passwords? Our ever-increasing dependence on the internet 
and digital devices has simplified many aspects of our lives. However, as we move more of our lives and personal 
information onto the web it becomes more cumbersome to manage the ever increasing amounts of passwords we must memorize.

PassLock v1.0 provides an interface 
for quickly adding and retrieving passwords and account information on your local machine. 
Upon adding a password, a .txt file named "my_passwords" is created on your local machine, in the "Documents" folder (Windows).
The file contains your added passwords and associated information such as account, username and email. Note that 
if the file is moved or renamed, you will not be able to retrieve it using PassLock v1.0. (An error message will be showed). 

NO INSTALL REQUIRED, JUST DOWNLOAD THE FILE AND RUN - PassLock v1.0 was written in JAVA and runs in your computer by using JRE - Java Runtime Environment. If you do not
have JRE in your computer you may download and install it by clicking HERE. https://java.com/en/download/

NOTE: Java technology allows you to run applications in a secure computing environment. Upon downloading the file you 
may be asked to confirm executing the file. It is completely safe to do so. *** Please see disclaimer below ***

(Read why you should not use the same password for different accounts, here http://blog.privatewifi.com/building-better-passwords/)

FEATURES:

PASSWORD RANDOMIZER - Can't think of a password for your account? Use the randomizer to generate passwords. By default, generated passwords are alphanumeric,
including upper and lower case letters. Alternatively, you can choose to add symbols by selecting "Alphanumeric + Symbol". You may choose how long your 
passwords may be (minimum 8 characters, maximum 12).

PASSWORD SEARCH - You may be able to retrieve your passwords by clicking the magnifying glass button. To quickly find a password, input a password's
associated account in the text-field and click the magnifying glass. Alternatevily, if you click the magnifying glass without inputing its account, a window 
will pop-up so to input the password's associated account. 


***DISCLAIMER*** Although fully functional, PassLock v1.0 was created for demonstration purposes only. Please be aware that passwords are kept in a plain text
file in your local machine - NO ENCRYPTATION IS USED. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR PRIVACY OR SECURITY ISSUES THAT MAY ARISE FROM YOUR USE OF THIS APPLICATION. USE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION.
